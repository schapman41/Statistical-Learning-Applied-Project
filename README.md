# Statistical-Learning-Applied-Project
This project aims to analyze a diabetes dataset using various statistical learning techniques 
including a generalized linear model, a generalized additive model, a classification 
tree and a simple feed forward neural network. 

The repository contains two files:
1. PDF Report:
The report file is a PDF document which contains more detailed information about the project, including information about the dataset,
background, methods used, results and conclusions. The report is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project and 
the techniques used.

2. Code:
The code file contains the script used to analyze the diabetes dataset and produce the results of the analysis.
The code is written in R and uses various libraries including...

To run the code, you will need to have a working version of R and the necessary libraries installed. 

Thank you for your interest in this project.
